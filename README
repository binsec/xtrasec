* Steps

1. Type ~make~. This will download the right PIN version (with ~wget~), untar it
   (~tar xvzf~), then compile versions for 32 & 64 bits.

   If you do not have access to the network, you need to download and untar
   PIN's tar archive, with the following steps:

   1. Download PIN 3.6 for Linux from 

     https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/downloads/pin-3.6-97554-g31f0a167d-gcc-linux.tar.gz


   2. Untar it in the this directory. 

      #+begin_src sh
        tar zxvf <directory>/pin-3.6-97554-g31f0a167d-gcc-linux.tar.gz
      #+end_src

      Your directory structure should now look like this:
      #+name: ls
      #+begin_src shell :results raw
      ls
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS: ls
      Makefile
      pin-3.6-97554-g31f0a167d-gcc-linux
      README
      src

      The 2 steps above are exactly what ~make pin~ does (it also removes the
      archive).

   3. Type ~make~


   

2. Test with

    #+begin_src sh
    make test
    #+end_src

* Docker

  To download the correct PIN version, type ~make pin~.

  PIN's license does not grant redistribution rights.
